#### We're going vaccine data for the top 5 countries with the most COVID-19 cases to date.  USA, India, Brazil, Russian Federation, UK.

```{r}
covid %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=cumulative_cases))+geom_density()
```
##### We have to figure out how to make this not a logarithmic scale.

##### We can use faceting to compare cases.

##### Use pivot wide to analyze a single country over time.

##### Create comparative plots

##### Find data on populations + governments of these countries to compare the covid data. (Along with vaccine data)

##### Maybe make a website that showcases our analysis of this data.
