```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



You should only load the libraries that you will use as part of your code. I removed a few and added lubridate.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
```

```{r}
library(here)
```

Let's use here to import the data. You can clean the names as part of the import.
```{r}
covid <- read.csv("Data/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

Take care of the date issue first.
```{r}
covid$i_date_reported <- lubridate::mdy(covid$i_date_reported)
```

Convert all of the `int` columns to `dbl`
```{r}
covid <- covid %>% mutate_if(is.integer,as.numeric)
```

```{r}
glimpse(covid)
```

Based on the way the data are organized, I don't think a scatterplot best represents the data. I think it would be more interesting to make a barplot where the x-axis is date and the y-axis allows users to select between the continuous variables. Then, country can be a filter variable. Have a look at the app below. I will leave the aesthetics up to you.
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
covid <- covid %>% 
  select(i_date_reported, country, cumulative_cases, cumulative_deaths)

ui <- dashboardPage(skin="purple",
  dashboardHeader(title = "COVID Cumulative Plot"),
  dashboardSidebar(disable = T),
  dashboardBody(
  fluidRow(
  box(title = "Plot Options", width = 3,
  selectInput("fill", "Select Country", choices =unique(covid$country)),
  radioButtons("x", "Select X Variable", choices = c("cumulative_cases", "cumulative_deaths"), selected = "cumulative_cases"),
  box(title = "Disease Abundance", width = 9,
  plotOutput("plot", width = "800px", height = "500px", click="plot_click"),
  verbatimTextOutput("info")
  ) 
  ) 
  )
  ) 
  )

server <- function(input, output, session) { 
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    covid %>% 
    filter(country==input$fill) %>% 
    ggplot(aes_string(x = "i_date_reported", y = input$x)) + 
    geom_col()
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
